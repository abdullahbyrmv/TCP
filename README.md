# TCP-Client-Server-Basic
This is just a basic TCP Server Java code. Run the classes inside src folder. You can manually change the message from TCPClient. Also in the code Socket ClientSocket = new Socket("192.168.31.98",6790);
you can change the IP address inside of new Socket to your own IP address. port number(6790) can be any number but in bot of the classes (TCPClient and TCPServer) this port number should be the same.
